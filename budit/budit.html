      <p>
        <strong>Brief:</strong>
        Online courses website designed to help children improve their acdemic performance.
      <p>
        <strong>My role: </strong>
        UI, UX, design system, prototype.
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose </strong>
        Provide online course for parents whose children are studing at elementary school. Let kids learn 
        easily, in a small piriod of time.
      <p>
        <strong>Problems: </strong>
        The website for children and parents, so the website should be easy to use.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We first looked into <span style="color:#5896A3;">our experience</span>. When we were students, we all spent
        a great amount of time at schools or cram schools.Therefore, we know some pain points in learning.
       </p>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Target Audience</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          Students aged 10 to 15 who want to learn faster and more efficient. Parents aged 30 to 50 whose
          children are studying at elementary school.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Interview</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          We tried to conduct interview to <span style="color:#5896A3;">gather deeper insight</span> about the topic.
          The interview questions sought to collect information about people's experience of learning. 
          By designing the questions, I apply the <span style="color:#5896A3;">golden circle
            approach</span> to discover more detail information.
        <p>
          <img src="Frame 1.png" alt="">
        <p>

          After collected the information, we found
          that laziness and bussiness happened in most of our interviewees. Parents sometimes did not want to use 
          the website because of diffculty. <span
            style="color:#5896A3;">I learn that length of courses and website usibility would be central issue that cause people often give
            up learning online. </span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Competitive Analysis</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          We started this process to understand those similar products in Taiwan. I also read some case study form
          internet to study more information. With those analysis I can have a chance to see what features work well and
          what are not. Also, I am able to <span style="color:#5896A3;">spot the common design patterns</span> that
          users may be used to. Then, we can figure out something to learn and improve when developing our website.
        <p>
          We found some online courses in Taiwan, we listed some main features. From the analysis, most website
          provide a main feature is to let users learn by themselves. There is no any practice or feedback. They all only
          want to sell their courses as fast as possible and ignore how to help students after the courses.
          
        <p>
          To sum up, many websites try to invite famouse people to introduce their courses.  
          But, except the course, there isn't any feebacks for users.

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        I created personas base on the interview data to help us focus on target users through the whole develop
        process. In the two personas, they cover our target users setting. One is child who want to use e-learning products
        . The other is a parent whose child studying at elementary school.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Establish Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on our target users and previous research to develop some key features.
      </p>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Goal</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          Buy courses at website easily. And provide a assistant after the courses.

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        After deciding on key features that may help users. I sorted those information form research to structure the
        product. I built the flow and user map to see which would work more logically.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Based on the flow , I sketched some wireframe to see if the system works. Those wireframes
        would help guide later stage design and interaction.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        I created the prototype to test the whole system. With the prototype, we can see
        if the user flow works smoothly.

      <h2>The Difficult of project</h2>
      <p>The most difficult in this project is about Cooperation.I have to conclude observations and recommendations and work with other engineers, 
      that is not difficult for me, but some back-end engineers resigned from the company. We have to start over to meet the new person and teach them 
      what we are making, what this project doing, need to spend lots of time let the project move.  </p>
     
    <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Solution</strong>    
      <p>The problem is that we donˊt have much time to wait for the new engineer, but engineersˊs work we can not give
      any advice. So I ask for the team to spend about one hour in the meeting to introduce what the project we actually do and what the problem
      we met.Finally,the new colleagues only spent a week to learn and working smoothly. </p>
